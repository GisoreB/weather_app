# weather_app

This Flutter weather application is designed to provide users with accurate weather information in an intuitive and user-friendly way. It fetches data from a weather API to display the current weather details, a complete 24-hour forecast, and a 14-day weather forecast. The app is built using the MVVM architecture and managed with the GetX state management library, ensuring a clean and maintainable codebase.
